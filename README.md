# Overview

This project focuses on solving **10 ad-hoc business requests** for a **Consumer Goods** company. The analysis was done using SQL to extract insights from the sales database, and the results were further visualized in Excel for clear communication.

The project is inspired by the Codebasics Resume Challenge, where the goal was to simulate a real-world business scenario and present insights in a structured and professional way.

4. Which segment had the most increase in unique products in 
2021 vs 2020?

5.  Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs. 

6.  Generate a report which contains the top 5 customers who received an average high  pre_invoice_discount_pct  for the  fiscal  year 2021  and in the Indian  market. 

7.  Get the complete report of the Gross sales amount for the customer  ‚ÄúAtliq Exclusive‚Äù  for each month  .
